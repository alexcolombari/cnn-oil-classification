# Convolutional neural network applied to predictive maintenence of industrial equipment using oil samples.

This is my Computer Science undergraduate thesis (Bachelors dissertation).

In this project, my idea is to implement an artificial intelligence model capable to make predictions and create some
reports about possible industrial failures finded in each image by my algorithm.

List of failures:

• Corrosive particles

• Fibers

• Spheres

• Black oxide

• Red oxide

• "Pullout"

• Rolling bearing

• Detrition

• Attrition

• Contaminants spheres

• Sand / Dirt

• Gear failures

• Lubricant degradation
